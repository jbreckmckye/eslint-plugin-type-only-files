# eslint-plugin-type-only-files

An ESLint plugin to support type-only files in TypeScript. Files with this rule enabled can only use types and interfaces.

### Why would I use this?

- You have `.ts` files that are only contain types / interfaces (e.g. `api.types.ts`)
- You want to exclude these files from things like unit test coverage
- But you also want ESLint to make sure no non-type code sneaks into these files

...then this plugin is for you.

## Usage

(todo, installation, setup, use with file patterns + coverage)

## Rule(s)
